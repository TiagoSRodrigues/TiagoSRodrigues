## Hi there!, I'm Tiago ðŸ‘‹

I am from a small town in the south of **Portugal**, I studied **Chemical Engineering**, **Industrial Management** and **Systems Engineering**.

This is my repository where I will keep some of what I have learned and some of my experiments. My idea is to store and share knowledge not necessary code.

### Some curiosities about me:
